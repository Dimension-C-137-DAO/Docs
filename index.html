Each WAGMI token is backed by a basket of assets (e.g. DAI, UST, WAGMI-DAI LP Tokens, WAGMI-UST LP Tokens, etc) in the Euphoria Treasury, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below. Similar to Wonderland and Olympus, Euphoria also introduces economic and game-theoretic dynamics into the market through staking and purchasing bonds.</li><li>In addition, we intend to bridge the gap between DeFi 1.0’s liquidity mining mechanisms and DeFi 2.0’s protocol owned liquidity mechanisms. ViperSwap and Euphoria can both be utilized to introduce new and unique mechanisms and products. We aim to combine the best that DeFi 1.0 has to offer with the best that DeFi 2.0 can offer.</li><li>As part of the VenomDAO ecosystem, Euphoria can work synergistically with VIPER.</li><li>Since VenomDAO already has an established treasury which has grown since ViperSwap was launched in March 2021, we have bootstrapped $192,766 into the initial Euphoria protocol without the need for prolonged whitelisting processes or having to rely on backdoor deals with VC:s. The protocol was announced, and initial liquidity was added to ViperSwap on November 7th 2021.</li><li>This is the only way a truly fair launch can happen where Discord insiders or VC:s don’t have an upper hand and can dump on market participants.</li><li>Eight months ago we fair launched ViperSwap on Harmony. Eight months later we’re still here, still pushing DeFi forward on Harmony.</li><li>And now we intend to lead the Harmony ecosystem towards the path of DeFi 2.0.</li></ul><p><a href="https://medium.com/venomdao/introducing-euphoria-an-algorithmic-reserve-currency-protocol-on-harmony-7581d17c38e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing Euphoria: an algorithmic reserve currency protocol on Harmony</a></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-midas">From Midas:<a class="hash-link" href="#from-midas" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li><p>CROWN is a decentralized reserve currency based on bonding and POL concept introduced by Olympus DAO, where community is formed when everyone bonds (mints) the underlying assets into a common reserve currency, creating a strong “bonding” for the whole community.
In accordance with this idea each CROWN token is backed by a basket of assets (MIM, CROWN-MIM LP etc) and other assets acquired during the second stage of project development, giving it an intrinsic value that it cannot fall below.</p><p>The introduction is divided into the sections listed below:</p></li><li><p>What are the advantages of the structure based on POL (I)</p><ul><li>Midas owns most of its liquidity thanks to its bond mechanism. This has several benefits:<ul><li>Midas does not have to pay out high farming rewards to incentivize liquidity providers,</li><li>Midas guarantees the market that the liquidity is always there to facilitate sell or buy transaction,</li><li>By being the largest LP (liquidity provider), it earns most of the LP fees which represents another source of income to the treasury,</li><li>All POL (and other assets) can be used to back CROWN (to increase intrinsic value). As a result, the value of CROWN tokens is at least equal to the total value of assets held in the treasury, without taking into account future inflows from Midas&#x27; unique profit-generating strategies, which makes the value of the treasury grow steadily every day.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Project basic strategies (II)</p><ul><li>There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and bonding. Stakers stake their CROWN tokens in return for more CROWN tokens, while Minters provide MIM or LP tokens in exchange for discounted CROWN tokens after a fixed vesting period.</li><li>The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new CROWN tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the stakers gain from  their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.</li><li>The main benefit for minters comes from price consistency. Minters commit a capital upfront and are promised a fixed return at a set point in time; that return is in CROWN and thus the Minter&#x27;s profit would depend on CROWN price when the bond matures. Minters benefit from a rising or static CROWN price.</li></ul></li><li><p>Midas&#x27; Kingdom (III)</p></li><li><p>Midas Touch (IV)</p></li><li><p>Get acquainted with proposed development stages, which distinguishes Midas from Olympus Dao and its forks (V)</p></li><li><p>Summary (VI)</p></li></ul><hr><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-hector">From hector:<a class="hash-link" href="#from-hector" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li><p>Stablecoins like USDT and USDC have become an integral part of the Crypto space. We use them to store non-volatile value, allowing us to maintain the same amount of purchasing power from day to day. Unfortunately, this isn’t actually how the US Dollar works. The Federal Reserve controls the minting of US Dollars, and it’s fiscal policies have consistently led to the depreciation of its currency. This means that a Dollar today is worth more than a Dollar tomorrow.</p><p><img alt="Purchasing-Power-of-the-U.S.-Dollar" src="/Docs/assets/images/Purchasing-Power-of-the-U.S.-Dollar-3916f14fe3eee499dffa45f12d9f7428.jpg"></p></li><li><p>This is why Hector DAO exists. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in general was the first step towards decentralisation. Hector DAO is the next step towards this goal. The native currency of Hector, $HEC will serve as a reserve currency backed by assets owned and maintained by a truly decentralised, autonomous protocol.</p></li><li><p>Similarly to Olympus, HEC is backed by DAI and other assets owned by the reserve treasury, and will function in a very similar way: when HEC trades below DAI, the protocol will buy back and burn HEC, increasing its price to at least 1 DAI. This means that HEC will always be worth equal to, or more, than DAI.</p></li><li><p>Hector DAO aims to become the de-facto reserve currency of the FTM Opera network, one which is truly owned and maintained by a decentralised protocol which serves the majority. Our goal is for $HEC to be a common trading pair which is backed by real assets.</p></li></ul><hr><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="from-sol">From Sol:<a class="hash-link" href="#from-sol" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><ul><li>Sol Invictus is the decentralized reserve currency built on Solana.
